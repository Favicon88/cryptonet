CryptoNet
=========

A node.js chatting application with crypto.

~~This is a simple project that I made to test out the 'crypto' module within node.js, I also wanted to make a chatting application.
So I did.~~

But then I was like, this could be better (after a year or so).
And I started reworking the project into a useable npm module.

## Known issues

The server crashes sometimes when a user loses connection.

## Install & run

Clone this repo and make a link to your global npm with `npm link` and start hacking!
